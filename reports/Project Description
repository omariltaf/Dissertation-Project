FC-UG-3: Large scale analysis of mobile trajectories

The availability of sensors in mobile phones enables 24/7 quantification of movements (e.g. in Google Fit, Appleâ€™s Healthkit) as well as the analysis of user behaviour. The behaviour can be used to support users in the management of their everyday life. For example Google Now tells users how long it will take to go home when the phone is accessed at a time when the user generally goes home from work. 

Goal of the project: goal of the project is to create a tool to analyse a collection of user traces to determine their habits (places they visit often at specific times) so to determine the interests and commitments of a specific person and in the end their lifestyle (person often jogging in a park, biking in the Peak district, involved in the school run on Mondays to Fridays, etc.). This will in turn enable to qualify the users and hence set the basis for a system able to suggest potential actions (e.g. go home, divert path, etc).

Using an app developed at the department of computer science, the student will first get acquainted with the data generated by tracking their own lifestyle. Then the student will have access to traces of thousands of users who have adopted the app and will be able to perform experiments over large scale so to - for example - cluster users according to interest, location and type of activity, etc.

The final outcome will be a model to classify users over large scale based on their interests.

Evaluation will be performed against real data provided by thousands of users.
